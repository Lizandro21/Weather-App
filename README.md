# Weather App!
---
Inside the master branch I have all the code from the index file, css and javascript for the weather app!
---
I was having issues with the API I tried trouble shooting for about 20 minutes until I realized I had the link in wrong and the API was correct.

The app is working. You can input your specifc city and it bring up the forcast for the next 5 days, plus the UVI, temperature, wind and more for todays weather. You can save different cities to then just click later on as well.
